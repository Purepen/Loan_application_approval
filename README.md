Financial Data Analysis for Loan Approval
Background
You work for a reputable bank that receives numerous loan applications daily. The bank aims to streamline its loan approval process by leveraging data analytics. Your task is to analyze historical loan data and create a model that predicts whether a loan application should be approved or denied.
Scenario
The bank has provided you with a dataset containing information about past loan applicants. The dataset includes features such as application date, credit score, income, loan amount, employment status, outstanding debt, employment start date, and loan outcome (approved or denied).
Tasks
1.	Data Exploration and Cleaning:
•	Load the loan dataset.
•	Check for missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
•	Explore the distribution of loan outcomes (approved vs. denied).
2.	Feature Engineering:
•	Create relevant features from the existing data. For example: 
	Debt-to-income ratio (DTI): Total debt payments divided by monthly income.
	Loan-to-income ratio: Loan amount divided by annual income.
	Employment length: Convert employment start date to years of experience.
•	Visualize the relationships between features and loan outcomes.
3.	Model Building:
•	Split the dataset into training and validation sets.
•	Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree, or random forest).
•	Train the model to predict loan approval based on features.
•	Evaluate the model’s performance using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score (justify the choice of metric(s) used).
4.	Model Interpretation:
•	Interpret the model coefficients or feature importances.
•	Identify which features have the most significant impact on loan approval decisions.
•	Provide insights into the risk factors affecting loan outcomes.
Deliverables
•	A well-documented Jupyter Notebook or Python/R script containing your data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
•	Visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, histograms, or ROC curves) to support your findings.
•	A summary explaining the model’s performance and key insights.
